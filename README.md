Diabetes Prediction
This project focuses on predicting diabetes using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset containing various health parameters and aims to classify whether a patient has diabetes or not. The dataset includes features such as Pregnancies (number of times pregnant), Glucose (plasma glucose concentration), Blood Pressure (diastolic blood pressure in mm Hg), Skin Thickness
(triceps skin fold thickness in mm), Insulin (2-hour serum insulin in mu U/ml), BMI (Body Mass Index), Diabetes Pedigree Function, and Age. The outcome variable indicates whether a person is diabetic (1) or not (0).

To run this project, install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt. The necessary libraries include Python 3.x, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib (optional for visualization). The implementation consists of data preprocessing (handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection), model selection (using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or SVM), model training and evaluation (splitting data into training and testing sets, training models, and evaluating accuracy), and making predictions using the trained model.

You can run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the code and see the results using jupyter notebook "Diabetes Prediction.ipynb". The model provides predictions on diabetes likelihood based on input health parameters. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess performance. Future enhancements include adding more data for better generalization, trying advanced machine learning models like deep learning, and deploying the model as a web application.
